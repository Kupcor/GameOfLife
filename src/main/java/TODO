For now GameOfLife works only "square" board/matrix (e.g 70x70, 50x50, 1200x1200) - to be more precise it works for every
dimensions but visualization not work correctly. Very interesting is example of board 50x100. In this situation there
are created two structures, two boards, which have cells every second row. This allows two "Game of life" activities to
work simultaneously on every second field. Need to be fixed.
